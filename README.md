# codeviz
The codeviz tool allows you to plot distribution functions generated with the numerical Fokker-Planck solver CODE [1, 2], weight with the synchrotron radiation emitted by the distribution and export to a format readable by the synthetic synchrotron diagnostic SOFT [3, 4]. This tool also helps you obtain the region in phase-space over which to do an integration in SOFT.
